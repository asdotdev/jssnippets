# jssnippets

A simple cross-browser extension to save JavaScript snippets for future reference and reuse.

This tool comes in handy if you often write scripts to perform repetitive or random tasks on web content. For example, if you need to choose random problems from a list, you might have had to save the script to a separate place or worry about it disappearing when the page reloads, but not anymore!
